## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

### Step 1: Clone or Download

*Option A: Using Git*
bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd stock_prediction_project


*Option B: Manual Download*
1. Download all project files to a folder named stock_prediction_project
2. Ensure you have these files:
   - app.py
   - advanced_stock_model.py
   - templates/index.html
   - static/style.css
   - requirements.txt

---

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)

*Windows*
bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate


*macOS/Linux*
bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate


> You should see (venv) in your terminal prompt indicating the virtual environment is active.

---

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don't have a requirements.txt, install packages manually:
bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn yfinance matplotlib seaborn flask xgboost ta


---

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Create a test file test_install.py:
python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
import flask
print("All imports successful! Installation complete.")


Run it:
bash
python test_install.py


---

### Step 5: Run the Application

bash
python app.py


You should see output similar to:
text
Initializing Stock Prediction App...
Pre-training model for RELIANCE.NS...
Training new model for RELIANCE.NS...
Fetching data for RELIANCE.NS...
...
Starting Flask server...
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Step 6: Access the Web App

Open your browser and navigate to:

## 🎯 Using the Application

1. *Select a Stock*  
   - Choose from pre-loaded Indian stocks (RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS, INFY.NS, etc.)  
   - Or enter a custom symbol (format: SYMBOL.NS for NSE stocks)

2. *Get Stock Information*  
   - Click *Get Stock Info* to view current market data  
   - Shows price, volume, market cap, sector info (where available)

3. *Make Predictions*  
   - Click *Predict Next Day* for ML-powered direction prediction  
   - View confidence scores and probabilities  
   - See model information and features used

4. *Supported Stocks (Examples)*  
   - *Large Cap:* RELIANCE, TCS, HDFCBANK, INFY, ICICIBANK  
   - *Mid Cap:* TATAMOTORS, AXISBANK, LT, ASIANPAINT  
   - *Tech:* WIPRO, TECHM, HCLTECH

## ⚙ Configuration Options

### Changing Default Settings

In app.py, you can change the default symbol and period:
python
# Change default stock or period
predictor = RobustStockPredictor(stock_symbol='TCS.NS', period='1y')

Available periods: '1y', '2y', '5y'

### Adding New Stocks

Edit the available_stocks endpoint/data structure in app.py:
python
'indian_stocks': {
    'Your Category': [
        {'symbol': 'NEWSTOCK.NS', 'name': 'New Stock Name'},
    ]
}

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### 1) Module Not Found Errors
bash
# Reactivate virtual environment and reinstall
deactivate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows
# venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2) Port Already in Use
bash
# macOS/Linux: Kill process using port 5000
lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9

# Or change port in app.py
app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)


### 3) Yahoo Finance Data Issues
- Check internet connection  
- Verify stock symbol format (must end with .NS for NSE)  
- Some tickers may have limited history

### 4) Model Training Failures
bash
# Clear cached models in current directory
python -c "import os; [os.remove(f) for f in os.listdir('.') if f.startswith('model_')]"

# Or through the web interface
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/clear_cache


---

## ⚡ Performance Tips

*For Faster Training*
- Reduce data period to 1y in app.py
- Decrease the number of estimators in models
- Use fewer technical indicators

*For Better Accuracy*
- Increase data period to 3y or 5y
- Add more technical indicators
- Experiment with different model parameters

*Restart the Application*
bash
# Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
python app.py


*Clear Model Cache*
bash
# Delete all saved models
rm model_*.pkl

# Or through the web interface:
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/clear_cache

## 🎓 Educational Notes

This application demonstrates:
- End-to-end ML pipeline: data collection → feature engineering → modeling → deployment
- Technical indicator engineering (via ta)
- Comparing multiple algorithms and selecting the best
- Web development with *Flask*
- Model persistence and caching strategies

---

## ⚠ Important Notes

- First run may take *2–5 minutes* as models train for each stock  
- Predictions are *not financial advice*  
- Model performance varies by stock and market conditions

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
- Check the *terminal output* for error messages  
- Verify *dependencies* are installed correctly  
- Ensure a *stable internet connection* for data fetching  
- Open browser *DevTools Console* (F12) for frontend errors  
- Refer to the *Troubleshooting* section above

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Experiment with different stocks  
- Modify technical indicators in advanced_stock_model.py  
- Tweak model parameters for better performance  
- Extend the feature set with additional indicators  
- Deploy to a cloud platform (Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.)
